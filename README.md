InfiniteWire (Slash Command Version) -
This github repository includes some of the source code to my discord bot.
You can do whatever you want with this, I don't really care. Just don't copy paste without reading the code.

"Copy pasting" -
You can use this code in your own bot if you want to, but make sure you know how this code works, as it's not well structured.
You can re-edit this code, make it function after your liking.
